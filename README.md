# CatsFortress

Welcome to the **Collaborative Game Dev with ChatGPT** project! In this repository, we are building a game together with the help of ChatGPT, an AI-powered coding assistant. The goal of this project is to explore the potential of AI-driven game development while fostering creativity, coding skills, and collaboration.

### Features:
- AI-assisted game development using ChatGPT.
- Interactive design of gameplay mechanics, story, and art.
- Easy-to-follow code and structure for beginners and experienced developers.
- Contributions from the community (ideas, code, art, etc.).

---

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Pygame**: Install via pip using `pip install pygame` (if working on a 2D game).

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/commonstory/CatsFortress.git
cd CatsFortress
```

### Run the Game
```bash
python game.py
```
This will launch the game in a window and let you start testing gameplay mechanics, interacting with code, and seeing AI-generated solutions in action.

### How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone! Whether youâ€™re a coder, artist, sound designer, or just someone with great ideas, your input is valuable.
